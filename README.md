# **Flask Microservice**

##### This program allows you to get data in json format when running Python Flask microservice. 

With the help of the Dockerfile file, you can easily run it on any device, even if there are no necessary libraries

---

# **Built with**

##### To create our search engine, we used 3 libraries:
-  The following 2 libraries are used to parse the necessary website: ```requests``` , ```BeautifulSoup```

-  To create the Flash microservice itself, the library is used ```Flask``` 

- And to convert information to json format, the ```json``` library
###### Each library used in our program is already built into the python language, so there is no need to resort to installing additional modules.

# **Usage**

To start the microservice, you only need to run image using the following command:

```docker run Dockerfile```
